# F1 Project

## Overview

The **F1 Project** is a mobile application built using **Expo** and **React Native** that integrates with the **api-sports.io** API. The app is designed to display data related to Formula 1, including drivers, races, and tracks. The project was created solely for learning purposes to explore mobile development, API integration, and React Native technologies.

This app fetches live data about F1 drivers, races, tracks, and more, providing an immersive experience for users interested in motorsports. It serves as an educational tool to study how to work with APIs and mobile application development.

## Learning Objectives

This project was created for educational purposes. It focuses on using modern technologies like **React Native**, **Expo**, **GraphQL**, and **API Integration** to build mobile apps. The goal is to understand how to fetch and display data in a mobile app while learning the tools and practices of mobile development.

### Key Technologies Used:
- **Expo**: For building cross-platform mobile apps.
- **React Navigation**: For handling navigation between different app screens.
- **api-sports.io**: To fetch live Formula 1 data.
- **React Native**: The core framework for developing the mobile app.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety throughout the codebase.
- **Day.js**: For efficient date and time manipulation.
